            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>WEB BASED</li>
                <P>Mostly <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>.Examples of some of my 'play time' projects include 
                    my <a href="http://mark-foyster.epizy.com/kayak/">Soggy Bottom</a> Kayak website, and my 
                    <a href="http://mark-foyster.epizy.com/watersports/index.php">Using Real Data</a> project. The source for the latter is available
                    on my <a href="https://github.com/mxfoyster">GitHub</a> page, the former is currently private as I have referenced some of the 
                    code in it as part of my <i>NCFE Level 3 Coding Concepts</i> course. It will be made public soon but can be looked at through 
                    other means by arrangement along with other work.</p> 
                    <p> I have designed and maintained a number of commercial websites over the years. Sadly, none of them are active any more as 
                        some time has passed.</p>
            
            <li>COMPILED</li>
                <p>Recently, <b>C#</b> (mostly Console and Unity3D ). I used to be quite fluent with <b>C++</b> but it's been a while 
                    (I intend to remedy Shortly!). Further back, I used to use <b>Pascal</b> in my late teens.</p> 
            
            <li>OTHER</li>
                <p>I have used various scripting languages including batch flies for DOS back in the day, assorted shell scripts in Linux, etc.</p> 
                <p>Recently, I picked up <b>Markdown</b> which I used to make GitHub Wiki's. Being as it's so simple, I wouldn't call it much of
                    a skill.</p>
                <p>As a child I programmed in various iterations of <b>Basic</b> quite a bit. It got me started.</P>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Environments (O/S)</h3>
            <p>Whilst a majority of my time has been spent within the <b>MS WIndows</b> environment, I really enjoyed the days of the <b>MS DOS</b>
                command prompt. I have played quite a bit with <b>Linux</b> in the past, I even had a stint with <b>Unix</b> and an old <b>Xenix</b>
                server that ran a number of Wyse terminals. I helped with routine maintenance on this system.</p>
                
                <p>I owned a <i>Macbook</i> for a few years which I loved and got used to the <b>OS-X</b> environment. Having the ability to open
                up a terminal and get to a <i>'Bash'</i> style environment was appealing to me too. In my youth, we had some legacy hardware
                around and I had the opportunity to play with some <i>TRS-80's</i> which ran <b>TRS-DOS</b> in 5 1/4" Floppy's which was fun.</p>

            <h3>Other Interests & Activities</h3>
            <p>I am interested in technology and science in general including engineering. I have played with electronics in the past including 
                Arduino. I maintain my own and immediate family's vehicles, from servicing and minor repairs to fixing MOT failures and breakdowns.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 2021, I took up Kayaking by joining a group based in Peterborough. I am thoroughly addicted to this passtime now
                and do it as often as I can. I have dabbled at playing guitar, I'm not great at it. I prefer piano / keyboard which I am a little 
                better at.</p>
            <p>I spent a majority of my adulthood, during spare time at first but later as a living, working around Horses. The time came when
                I was no longer young or flexible enough to dedicate my life to this, it's a hard industry.</p>
