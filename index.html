            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <img  id="headShot" src="images/mugshot2.png" alt="Photo of me, quite ugly">
            <div id="intro-div">
            <p>Good <span id="day_time">day</span>. If you're here, you're probably interested in learning a little more about me. You are in the 
            right place. Please excuse the ugly mug shot, I'm not exactly photogenic and I took this one in a hurry. It's a slight improvement on 
            the one in my Linkedin and Github account.</p> 

            <p>Below are a few details, mostly about my IT background. At the very bottom, there is a bit more information about my other interests.
            On a more general note, I would like to add that I love problem solving, and whilst I'm not afraid to use an existing solution, I 
            thrive when I have the opportunity to create my own. It is for these reasons that software development and I fit together well.</p>

            <p>Feel free to skip past anything that doesn't interest you, I've tried to put something in here for everyone which means things can 
                get a little long winded in places.</p>

            <p>If you don't see the information you want or you would like a copy of my CV, please feel free to tap the email symbol on the right 
                hand side of the footer and send me a message.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <div id="langBodyDiv">
            <ul>
            
            <li>WEB BASED</li>                
                <h4>Current:</h4>
                    <p><b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>  both recently and long term. Most recently this has
                        been for personal projects and as material for the L3 NCFE Coding Practices course. I'm interested in learning React.js or a 
                        similar framework soon, I wish to polish up my JavaScript further first.</p>
                    <p>I have recently used <b>XML</b> in two of the projects I link to below for a simple <i>'semi-structured'</i>  'flat file' 
                        database.</p>
                    <p>Very recently, I have been playing with <b>JSON</b>, in fact I use it to load data for <i>'pop-ups'</i> further down on 
                            this website. I'm using the <i>fetch()</i> API to load the file.</p> 

                <h4>In the past:</h4>
                    <p><b>XML</b> and <b>XSLT</b> combined with above technologies to make a simple CMS system for a Business Forum website.</p> 
                    
                    <p>I played with <b>PERL</b> a bit before PHP became popular (very distant past). </p>               
                    <p> I have designed and maintained a number of commercial websites over the years. Sadly, none of them are active any more as 
                        some time has passed.</p><hr/>
            
            <li>COMPILED</li>
                
                <h4>Current:</h4>
                <p><b>C#</b> with simple console apps and within Unity3D. Again, this was for a mixture of personal projects and for assessment 
                material. I will look at more detail at some of the other parts of the <b>.NET</b> framework soon.   
                <h4>In the past:</h4>
                <p><b>C++</b>, mostly for fun and during a Level 2 course I did many years ago. I look forward to brushing up on this soon.</p>     
                <p><b>Pascal</b> during my College days and for a while afterwards. Mostly Borland Turbo Pascal, I had my share of fun with 
                this language:</p> <hr>
              
            <li>OTHER</li>
                <p>I have used various scripting languages including batch files for DOS back in the day, assorted shell scripts in Linux, etc.</p> 
                <p>Recently, I picked up <b>Markdown</b> which I used to make GitHub Wiki's. Being as it's so simple, I wouldn't call it much of
                    a skill.</p>
                <p>As a child I programmed in various iterations of <b>Basic</b> quite a bit. It got me started.</P>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Other Related Skills</h3>
            <div class="otherBodyDivs">
            <p>Other technologies related to sooftware development that I have skills in include <b>GIT CLI <i>(Bash Git)</i></b> which I have began 
                using recently in place of <b>GitHub Desktop</b> of which I am also familiar. Naturally, I have a <b>GitHub</b> account that I use 
                alongside these. For development environments, I use <b>Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition)</b> for compiled code. For 
                Interpreted (web) based code I use <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, having moved on from <b>Notepad++</b> which was my main-stay for 
                quite a while.</p>
            
            <p>I use <b>Unity Hub</b> for my Unity 3D work which integrates well with Visual Studio. It's quite nice for a visual environment and 
                i found it quite easy to get the hang of. I use <b>Audacity</b> if I need to edit audio files, though that's not often. I wish to
                learn <b>Blender</b> for modelling etc, but it's a lower priority right now.</p>

            <p>For web based work, I run <b>APACHE</b> server on my PC through <b>XAMPP</b>. I used to have an old PC that I installed <b>Linux</b>
                onto and ran within a local network as a substitute for this. I found this better for testing across different environments and
                different browsers. I'd like to do that again given the resources. Whilst on the subject of the web, I dabbled in the past with 3rd 
                party CMS systems including <b>Joomla</b> and <b>Wordpress</b>. Whilst I prefer to hand code sites, I did find Joomla quite 
                customisable and not too tricky to build templates for.</p>

            <p>For image editing, my main choice is <b>GIMP</b> which being free, makes it all the better. I'm not an expert user, but I can get 
                done what I need to. For lo-fo / mid-fi prototype interfaces, my choice of tool is <b>MS Powerpoint</b>. For practically anything
                else, I find Google is my friend and there are endless resources out there. That said, I HATE copying and pasting someone else's 
                code. I am more prone to learning from an example and making my own version, given the choice.</s>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Environments (O/S)</h3>
            <div class="otherBodyDivs">
            <p>Whilst a majority of my time has been spent within the <b>MS Windows</b> environment, I really enjoyed the days of the <b>MS DOS</b>
                command prompt. I have played quite a bit with <b>Linux</b> in the past, I even had a stint with <b>Unix</b> and an old <b>Xenix</b>
                server that ran a number of Wyse terminals. I helped with routine maintenance on this system.</p>
                
                <p>I owned a <i>Macbook</i> for a few years which I loved and got used to the <b>OS-X</b> environment. Having the ability to open
                up a terminal and get to a <i>'Bash'</i> style environment was appealing to me too. In my youth, we had some legacy hardware
                around and I had the opportunity to play with some <i>TRS-80's</i> which ran <b>TRS-DOS</b> in 5 1/4" Floppy's which was fun.</p>

            <h3>I.T. Qualifications</h3>
            <div id="langBodyDiv">
                <h4>NCFE Level NCFE Level 3 User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)</h4>
                <p><b>Ongoing</b> I will begin studying this on the 19th April 2022 unless I get a job that would make this impractical. The 
                course is very much as described. More information on it's contents is available 
                <a href="https://www.qualhub.co.uk/media/19898/603-7619-3-qualification-specification-version-10.pdf"> HERE</a>.</p>
                <h4>NCFE Level 3 Certificate in Coding Practices</h4>
                <p>Completed in early April 2022 pending moderation, this course covered much more than just code. It focused on the entire 
                    development cycle and made strong reference to <i>Scrum</i> and other <i>Agile</i> methodologies. Additionally, we were taught 
                    about Test Driven Development, UI/UX, Deployment and many other areas of Software engineering. More information on the course
                    content can be found <a href="https://www.qualhub.co.uk/media/20704/603-5793-9-qualification-factsheet-version-10.pdf">HERE</a>.
                 </p>
                 <h4>TQUK Level 2 Certificate in IT User Skills (RQF)</h4>
                 <p>Pretty basic stuff completed 10th Degember 2021. Using the standard <i>MS Office</i> apps or similar, internet, email etc. 
                    Understanding about security and data integrity. It was free and whilst I am able to use pretty much any software, it doesn't 
                    hurt to have a piece of paper that proves it. More information about the content

                    HERE</a>.</p>
                <h4>City & Guilds level 2 in programming C++</h4>
                <p>This is an oldie, back around 1995 - 1996. This was completely based on C++, Borland if I recall correctly. We made simple
                    Console based programs, learnt how to handle and sort data directly, garbage collect and a little bit of <i>OOP</i>. 
                    I continued afterwards to further develop these skills. It's been a while now, but I am very keen to go back to it.</p>

            <h3>Other Interests & Activities</h3>
            <div class="otherBodyDivs">
            <p>I am interested in technology and science in general including engineering. I have played with electronics in the past including 
                Arduino. I maintain my own and immediate family's vehicles, from servicing and minor repairs to fixing MOT failures and breakdowns.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 2021, I took up Kayaking by joining a group based in Peterborough. I am thoroughly addicted to this passtime now
                and do it as often as I can. I have dabbled at playing guitar, I'm not great at it. I prefer piano / keyboard which I am a little 
                better at.</p>
            <p>For much of my adult life until recently, I have been around Horses. First this was a hobby but later I made a living working within 
                the equine trade. The time came when I was no longer young or flexible enough to dedicate my life to this, it's a hard industry.</p>
